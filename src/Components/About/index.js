                Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. 
                Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked 
                around the hive. You did come back different.

                Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from 
                the hive. I can't do this"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. 
                What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue 
                humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. 

                How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? 
                It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just 
                freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. 
                It's a horrible, horrible disease.
